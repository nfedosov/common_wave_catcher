% BST_GAIN_ORIENT: Constrain source orientation on a leadfield matrix
%
% USAGE:  Gain = bst_gain_orient(Gain, GridOrient, GridAtlas)
%
% INPUT: 
%     - Gain       : [nChannels,3*nSources] leadfield matrix
%     - GridOrient : [nSources,3] orientation for each source of the Gain matrix
% OUTPUT:
%     - Gain : [nChannels,nSources] leadfield matrix with fixed orientations

% Regular case: 3 orientations => 1 orientation
G3 = load(G3_dir);
Gain = G3.Gain(channel_idx,:);

    % Create a sparse block diagonal matrix for orientations
GridOrient = blk_diag(G3.GridOrient', 1);
    % Apply the orientation to the Gain matrix
Gain = Gain * GridOrient;
% Mixed head model: mixed unconstrained and constrained regions
